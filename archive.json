It is straightforward to define an IES-ML-KEM (by simply replacing DH with ML-KEM), is that too big of an innovation?  How about using ML-KEM for authentication; should we endorse the protocol proposed in draft-celi-wiggers-tls-authkem?",

          "body": "I don't think IETF has an official spec for IES. If that is true, it is more like we'd need to write a spec for that.  With a ML-KEM certificate, the certificate owner may not need signatures for its identity authentication.  For example, one can add an optional ML-KEM certificate in \"Key Exch\" in Figure 1, TLS 1.3, then the client never needs \"Certificate\" and \"CertificateVerify\", so the server never needs to ask for \"CertificateRequest\".  That is due to the MAC confirmation at the end of the handshake.   \r\n\r\nTo improve efficiency, the client just sends a hash of its certificate if the server saves the certificate for later connections.  If one uses PQ sig to sign the certificate, the certificate is big.  And most connections, the key exchanges do not have \"Certificate\" and \"CertificateVerify\" messages.  If one uses an ECC sig at this moment, then the size cost is basically the ML-KEM public key. \r\n\r\nOne can also do ephemeral key exchanges by sending a fresh public ML-KEM key a long with the certificate and this fresh public key will be used for the next connection. In the next connection, the certificate does not need to to be sent again, just send a new fresh public ML-KEM key for the future connection and the hash of the public key to be used for this current exchange.  But this method requires extensions and the server to save the future ML-KEM public key.  \r\n\r\nBut that way has PQ security for both (KEM and authentication) without needing PQ signatures to be exchanged for every connection because the authentication is from the security of ML-KEM and the MAC.
